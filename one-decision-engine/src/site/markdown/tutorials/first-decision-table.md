# Your first decision table

Let's start at the very beginning, as the song says, 'a very good place to start'. We're going to create a decision table that will provide a very simple classification of risk for an applicant for health insurance. It needs just two pieces of information: the applicant's age range and a self-assessed judgement of whether (s)he is in good or bad health.  

## Summary of steps to perfprm

  - Open the decisions application in your browser and navigate to the decisions list 
  - Click the plus icon to add a new decision table 
  - Add condition rows for age range and state of health
  - Add a conclusion row for the risk rating.
